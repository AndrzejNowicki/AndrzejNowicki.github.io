So... I decided to create a blog :)

I wanted to use this occasion to learn something new on the way, so I decided to use [Jackyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/). This way, I don't have to care about the hosting, distributing the newest version, etc. . The only thing left was to find a theme...

There are many interesting themes available for free on the Internet. I found several themes I really liked, but I had choose one... So I went with [Minimal Mistakes](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes) by [Michael Rose](https://mademistakes.com/).

## Customization

It was really easy to customize the author information visible in the sidebar. Linking my Linkedin and Github account was simply a matter of entering my username in `_config.yml` file.
However, I wanted to show off my OCP badge so I had to customize the sidebar on left some more.
All I had to do was add this snippet of code to `_includes/_author-bio.html`:
{% highlight html %}
{% raw %}
{% if author.acclaim %}
	<a href="https://www.youracclaim.com/user/{{ author.acclaim }}" class="author-social" target="_blank">
		<img style="margin-top: 10px; width:90%" src="{{ site.url }}/images/oracle_professional_XL.png" alt="Oracle Certified Professional badge">
	</a>
{% endif %}
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

Then, I configured my acclaim username in the `_config.yml` and uploaded the badge image. And it worked!
