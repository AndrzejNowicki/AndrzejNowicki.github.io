I decided to create a blog :)

I wanted to use learn something new on the way so I decided to stick with [Jackyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/). The only thing left is a theme... It took me some time to find an interesting theme I'd like, but finally I went with [Minimal Mistakes](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes).
