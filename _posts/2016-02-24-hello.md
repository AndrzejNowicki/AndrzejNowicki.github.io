So... I decided to create a blog :)

I wanted to use this occasion to learn something new on the way, so I decided to use [Jackyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/). This way, I don't have to care about the hosting, distributing the newest version, etc. . The only thing left was to find a theme...

There are many interesting themes available for free on the Internet. It took me some time to find a theme I like. I found several themes I really liked and had to go with one... So I went with [Minimal Mistakes](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes) by [Michael Rose](https://mademistakes.com/).

If you're interested in the internals of this website, feel free to have a look at the [source code](https://github.com/AndrzejNowicki/AndrzejNowicki.github.io) available on github.
