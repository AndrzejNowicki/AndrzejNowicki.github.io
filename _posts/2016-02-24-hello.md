So... I decided to create a blog :)

I wanted to use this occasion to learn something new on the way, so I decided to use [Jackyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/). This way, I don't have to care about the hosting, distributing the newest version, etc. . The only thing left was to find a theme...

There are many interesting themes available for free on the Internet. It took me some time to find a theme I like. I found several themes I really liked and had to go with one... So I went with [Minimal Mistakes](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes) by [Michael Rose](https://mademistakes.com/).

## Customization

I wanted to show off my OCP badge so I had to customize the author information shown in the sidebar on left.

All I had to do was add this line of code:
{% highlight html %}
{% raw %}
{% if author.acclaim %}<a href="https://www.youracclaim.com/user/{{ author.acclaim }}" class="author-social" target="_blank">
	<img style="margin-top: 10px; width:90%" src="{{ site.url }}/images/oracle_professional_XL.png" alt="Oracle Certified Professional badge"> </a>
  {% endif %}
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}
